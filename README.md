## Description
Hostel Check-In System is a Next.js + TypeScript application designed to help hostel managers efficiently track check-ins, check-outs, and tenant transactions. The system enables secure user authentication, records tenant details, manages payments, and monitors room availability in real-time. With a polished, interactive UI and a backend powered by Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, this project streamlines hostel operations while ensuring data security through JWT authentication. The application is designed for easy deployment using Vercel and Render for seamless cloud hosting.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Usage
### User Story
AS A HOSTEL MANAGER, I want to:
- Record and track the check-in and check-out process of each tenant as a unique transaction.

WHEN A tenant checks in, I want to:
- Collect the following information as part of a unique transaction:
  - First Name
  - Last Name
  - Room Number
  - Deposit Amount
  - Payment Amount
  - Check-in Date
- Automatically calculate their check-out or renewal date based on their payment.

WHEN I log in each day, I want to:
- See a weekly view of tenants who are required to check out or renew within the next 7 days.

- WHEN I renew a tenant and accept payment, I want to:
Update their existing check-in transaction to reflect the additional payment for the room.

WHEN A tenant checks out, I want to:
- Record the room they are vacating.
- Mark the transaction as complete.
- Display the returned deposit amount.
